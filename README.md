# Vite + Quart Cross-Platform Packager Boilerplate with Electron

## Overview

This template provides a ready-to-use environment for building and packaging a cross-platform application using Vite for the frontend and Quart for the backend. The setup utilizes Docker to containerize both services and Electron to create a standalone executable for your application. 

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have Docker, Docker Compose, and Node.js installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions for these tools here:
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Repository Structure

The boilerplate is structured as follows:

```

## Setting Up Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:albertbuchard/vite-quart-cross-platform-boilerplate.git
   cd vite-quart-cross-platform-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Create the `.env` file**:

   Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and adjust the PORT variables if needed.
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. **Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Node.js**:
   Follow the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installation guides.

## Running the Application

1. **Build for local development**:
   
   Navigate to the root directory and use Docker Compose to build and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This will start the frontend and backend services for local development.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Run the Electron application**:
   - Navigate to the `electron` directory and start the Electron application. 
   - This will launch a window that opens the frontend and controls the backend services
   -  If you use `npm start` or `npm run package` to package the application the hot reload will still work
   -  Use `npm run make` to package the application for prod without hot reload.
   ```bash
   cd electron
   npm install
   npm start
   ``` 

## Packaging the Application

To package the application into a standalone executable for different platforms, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `electron` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd electron
   ```

2. **Install the necessary npm packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the packaging script**:

   * This will create executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows in the `dist` or `out` directory depending on the packaging script used. 
   * The packaging options should be defined in the `electron/forge.config.js` file (see [Electron Forge Configuration](https://www.electronforge.io/configuration) for more details).
         
   ```bash
   npm run package # in /out
   # OR
   npm run make # in /out
   ```
   
4. **Access the packaged application**:
   After a make on macOS with the `@electron-forge/maker-dmg` maker set in the `forge.config.js` file, the `.dmg` file will be created in the `out/make` directory. You can then install the application by dragging it to the Applications folder.

## Development Notes

- **Frontend**: The Vite-based frontend is located in the `frontend` directory. Use `npm run dev` for development and `npm run build` to build the production assets.
- **Backend**: The Quart-based backend is in the `backend` directory. You can run it locally with `python app.py`, or use Docker to containerize it.
- **Electron**: The Electron application is in the `electron` directory. You can develop and test the Electron app by running `npm start` inside the `electron` directory.

## Additional Information

- **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file is crucial for setting up the environment. Ensure it is properly configured.
- **Electron**: The `main.js` script in the `electron` directory is responsible for starting the Docker services and launching the frontend URL in a window. It also ensures Docker services are shut down when the window is closed.
- **Packaging**: The `electron/package.json` file contains scripts and configuration for packaging the application into standalone executables using `electron-builder`.
